Selection sort
The general strategy of the selection sort algorithm is as follows:
Scan  the  entire  list  to  find  the  smallest  value.  
put it first in list
Scan the rest of the list to find the smallest value, 
and then exchange it with the value in the second position of the list. and so on


Insertion sort
The insertion  sort algorithm  sorts  a  list  of  values  
by  repetitively inserting a particular value into a subset of the list 
that has already been  sorted.  
One  at  a  time,  each  unsorted  element  is  inserted  at
the appropriate position in that sorted subset until the entire list is in order.


Quick sort
First,choose one element of the list to act as a partition element. 
Next, partition the list so that all elements less than the partition element 
are to the left of that element and all elements greater than the partition element 
are to the right. Finally, apply this quick sort strategy (recursively) to both partitions.


Bubble sort
Sorts values by repeatedly comparing neighboring elements in the list 
and swapping their position if they are not in order relative to each other.
